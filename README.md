# Taskly
  Description:
  Date to be saved on the server: For our update plan, we decided to introduce a new feature where users can create an account to gain access to special privileges on our website. When they open the      link to our site, they will be directed to the login page, which asks for their email address and password. There will also be a button on the same page to create a new account, which gets the user's   profile picture, name, username, email address, and password.

  Once the user has filled up all the needed information from the login page, they can finally access the website itself. A small icon of their profile picture will appear on the right side of the        navigation bar. If they click this icon, they will be able to edit their profile or add a new account. Additionally, when the user is creating a new task, their input will now be sent to the database   wherein it can be stored, retrieved, or edited all throughout the website.
  
  How the data will be used: We plan to ask some personal information to retrieve the users tasking page upon login. Similarly, we decided to refine the way we retrieved their task data by using the      POST method.
